# Canvas Refined

I don't like the direction bettercanvas (bettercampus) is heading so I forked it

They tried to change license but forgot to rebase so this is based on the MIT licensed version and fully legal 🙃

There is a dev branch for active alpha if you really want

# Get it now!

1. get it on the [chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/canvasrefined/ihienfbdfdamhmhhiokjnjmpjgbenedg)!

## Contributing

### Add a new feature

To contribute to this, first either make an issue with feature suggestion or post in the discord.

If nobody is working on the feature, you can clone the dev branch and make your changes while following these guidelines.

#### Identifier

- Should be a unqiue one/two word storage identifier to indicate its status. (ie "dark_mode" or "dashboard_grades")
- If it has sub options (options that are specific to the main feature) these will also each need a unique identifier.
- All options are synced and have an 8kb storage limit, so if your feature needs more than this please contact me.

#### Changes to html/popup.html

- Add the appropriate HTML into this file. The corresponding id and name (see below) should be the identifier.
- If it has no sub options, it should be put in the same container as the other options with no sub options:

```
<div class="option" id="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="off" name="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="on" name="<identifier>">
    <div class="slider">
        <div class="sliderknob"></div>
        <div class="sliderbg"></div>
    </div>
    <span class="option-name"><option name></span>
</div>
```

- If it does have sub options it becomes its own container:

```
<div class="option-container">
  <div class="option" id="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="off" name="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="on" name="<identifier>">
    <div class="slider">
      <div class="sliderknob"></div>
      <div class="sliderbg"></div>
    </div>
    <span class="option-name"><option name></span>
  </div>
  <div class="sub-options">
    <div class="sub-option">
      <input type="checkbox" id="<sub identifier>" name="<sub identifier>">
      <label for="<sub identifier>" class="sub-text"><option name></label>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Changes to js/popup.js

- Add the main identifier into the `syncedSwitches` array.
- If you have sub-options:
  - Add these identifiers to the array found under the comment that says `//checkboxes`.

#### Changes to js/background.js

- Add all identifiers into the `syncedOptions` array.
- Add a default value for your option to the `default_options` array.
  - Preferably this value should be `false` for booleans or ` ""` for strings (`null` can also be used if Canvas has a default for this option already)

#### Changes to js/content.js

- There should be a function(s) included in the this file that does the work. The name should clearly indicate its purpose.
- Under `applyOptionsChanges()`, add a switch case to call this function when the menu toggle is changed.
- Depending on what your feature does, it needs to be told when to fire.
  - If the function changes any aspect of the dashboard, it should be put inside `checkDashboardReady()`.
  - If the function only adds css, it should be added to `applyAestheticChanges()`, and in this case should not be a separate function, instead add the css to the existing styles found in this function.
  - Anything else should be put under `startExtension()` and should be placed no higher than the `checkDashboardReady()` call found there.
